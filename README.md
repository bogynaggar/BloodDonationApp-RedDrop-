People do donate blood, but availablity of blood at right time is most important for a patient.This app connects with all doners who have registered in this app to create a database of doners.
A person in need can request for blood doner and instantly all the doners of that specific bloodgroup will be notified. Now aa doner can revert back to the person who requested using the contact number mentioned by the 
request sender.
The application is built on firebase entirely which makes it really light.It uses firebase functions to create the server side code for automatic sending of push notification.
